#Bet-Tracking Repository.

Repository used to upload all the code generated for the project.

## How - To. v0.0

To minimize the possible problems generated by multiple developers working on the same project the next rules should always be followed:

* Every developer working on a feature will be committing all its progress to a separated branch. 
* On every sprint there should always be one branch open for every feature in progress.
* NOBODY is allowed to commit directly to the master branch.
* Once a feature development has ended, another developer will review the results. If the development is approved the feature branch will be merged to the master branch.
*Changes on the core code will affect all feature development and therefore all developers will have to implement that change before merging to the master branch.
